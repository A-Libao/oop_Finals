# Project Assessment Rubric

**Project:** E-Commerce System
**Section:** C2B
**Course:** Object Oriented Programming

## Grading Breakdown

### 1. Class Diagram Completeness (25%)
**Score:** 5/5
**Notes:** Complete and detailed UML class diagram provided as PNG file (UML.png) locally in the project directory. The diagram is comprehensive and shows clear relationships between classes.

### 2. Java Program - OOP Concepts (50%)
**Score:** 4/5
**Notes:** Good implementation of OOP concepts:
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields with public getters/setters in Product, User, Order, and Entity classes
- **Inheritance:** Entity abstract class serves as base class (though limited concrete implementations shown in reviewed files)
- **Polymorphism:** Method overriding with toString() in multiple classes; static factory methods (fromString) demonstrate polymorphic behavior
- **Abstraction:** Abstract Entity class and Persistable interface demonstrate abstraction
The project shows solid OOP principles but could benefit from more extensive inheritance hierarchies and polymorphic method implementations.

### 3. Git Usage & Collaboration (15%)
**Score:** 2/5
**Notes:** Minimal collaboration with only 2 contributors: A-Libao (7 commits) and Michael Ong (1 commit). Heavily dominated by one contributor, suggesting limited team participation. The project name mentions three people (Libao, Pilay, Vinas) but git history only shows two contributors.

### 4. Base Grade (10%)
